## Prohibited materials

!!! warning ""
    The following materials should _NEVER_ be placed into the laser cutter.

|Material|Reason|
|--------|------|
|polycarbonate|Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas|
|vinyl|Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas|
|PVC|Melts instead of burns, releases chlorine gas|
|Neoprene|Sublimated vapors damage the optics|
|Moleskin notebooks|Contains chlorine, releases poison gas|
|ABS|Burning ABS releases hydrogen cyanide gas|
|self-laminated or glued|Anything you laminated yourself or glued together is a fire hazard|
|low-grade plywood|Excessive bowing can cause the gantry to catch on the wood being cut|

## Pre-flight checklist

!!! info "Before every use"
    1. Make sure that the machine and workspace are clutter-free.  **The laser cutter is not a table**.
    1. Have a plan for putting out small fires without causing damage to the machine.  A small spray bottle of tap water
      or rag for smothering is usually fine for this purpose.  Verify a fire extinguisher is easily accessible in case
      things go wrong.
    1. Check that the auxiliary systems (chiller, air and exhaust) are properly connected and functional.  The Air pump
      is internal to the machine, and controlled by software. The chiller and exhaust impeller should be plugged
      directly into the laser cutter, and should turn on when the machine is running.


## Operation checklist

!!! tldr "Operational Safety"
    1. Ensure material to be cut is safe to use. See Consumable Material Reference for details.
    1. Never leave a laser cutter unattended when running a job
    1. Take care to select appropriate power/speeds settings to avoid combustion. Always start jobs with lowest power
       if unsure.

### Basic Operation Checklist

(FIXME)


## Post-flight checklist

!!! info "End of operation and clean-up"
    1. Power down the machine
    1. Wipe surfaces
    1. Clean debris from inside as needed with shop vac.
